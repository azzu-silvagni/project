# CONCLUSIONS

***

The proposed improvements address key aspects of the [ArCo](https://dati.beniculturali.it/arco/index.php) Knowledge Graph, including **visual depiction**, **date of construction**, **commissioner**, and related **historical connections** and **events**. Currently, the knowledge graph lacks many of these links concerning [**Caterina Sforza**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Sforza) and her architectural legacy in [**Imola**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola) and [**Forlì**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forl%C3%AC).

The triples we created help enrich both the quality and the completeness of the dataset, offering a clearer picture of the **historical relevance** of [**Rocca di Imola**](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocca_sforzesca_di_Imola) and [**Rocca di Ravaldino**](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocca_di_Ravaldino). 

This project not only contributes to improving the existing knowledge graph but also provides a **foundation for future studies** on the role of **female historical figures** and the **cultural heritage of [Romagna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna)**.

In conclusion, this investigation into the architectural heritage of [Romagna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna) has revealed the importance of integrating **semantic technologies** and [**LLMs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to enhance the **coverage, expressiveness, and usability** of the [ArCo](https://dati.beniculturali.it/arco/index.php) Knowledge Graph.
