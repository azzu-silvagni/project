# METHODOLOGY

This section outlines the approach and steps taken to investigate the **architectural heritage** of **Romagna**, focusing on **two fortresses** historically linked to **Caterina Sforza**.

The project was carried out through a series of structured phases, combining **semantic technologies** and **historical research**.
Click on the highlighted sections below to explore each stage of the process in detail.

- **ArCo**

- **SPARQL**

- **Large Language Models**

- **RDF Triples**

- **GitHub**

# Step 1: ArCo

## What is the ArCo Ontology?

The **ArCo Ontology** is a set of semantic vocabularies developed to describe and structure data related to Italian cultural heritage.
It is part of the broader **[ArCo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/) (Architecture of Knowledge)** project, promoted by the [Italian Ministry of Culture](https://cultura.gov.it/).

[ArCo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/) provides a formal model for representing cultural heritage objects, people, places, events, and their relationships — enabling **interoperability**, **linked open data**, and **semantic reasoning** within knowledge graphs.

## What is the ArCo SPARQL Editor?

The **[ArCo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/) [SPARQL Query Editor](https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql)** is an online tool that allows users to interact with the **[ArCo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/) Knowledge Graph**.
Through this editor, it is possible to write and run SPARQL queries to access, explore, and retrieve structured data from the dataset.

This querying process also enables the discovery of **semantic relationships** between different cultural heritage entities, as defined by the **[ArCo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/) ontologies**.

# Step 2: SPARQL

## What is SPARQL?

**SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)** is a query language used to access and manipulate data stored in the **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** format.
It allows users to retrieve, filter, and explore structured data from knowledge graphs by writing specific query patterns.

# Step 3: Large Language Models

# Step 4: RDF Triples

## What is RDF?

**RDF (Resource Description Framework)** is a standard model for representing structured data on the Web.
It is used to describe resources — such as people, places, artworks, or historical events — and the relationships between them, in a way that is **machine-readable and semantically meaningful**.

RDF expresses data in the form of **triples**, which are the basic building blocks of a knowledge graph.

## Structure of an RDF Triple

Each RDF triple consists of three parts:

- **Subject**: the entity being described

- **Predicate**: the property or relationship that connects the subject to something else.

- **Object**: The value or target of the relationship. This can be either a literal (like a string or a date) or another resource.
